# news-youtube-wikidata-mapping
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that queries the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint to collect news and media organisationsâ€™ YouTube channel information.
It deduplicates the results by domain and channel ID and outputs the cleaned data to CSV and JSON.

Useful for researchers and developers looking to map news outlets to their official YouTube channels.
